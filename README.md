# Overwatch Collegiate Tracker

---

OWCT aims to provide a single source of, up-to-date, information for all those who follow and are interested in the Collegiate Overwatch scene.

<br>

## Features
- Present and Past tournament team display
    - Not all past tournaments are stored, only ones of interest or requested.
- Team member skill rating displays
- Team average and top 6 average skill rating
    - These are pulled from overbuff.com so skill rating of players with private profiles can be very outdated
- Match results

*Note: Until GameBattles requires more information storing like map type and score all that can be collected is a win loss and team played.*
