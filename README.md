OWCT aims to provide a single source of, up-to-date, information for all those who follow and are interested in the Collegiate Overwatch scene.

## Features
- Present and Past tournament team display
    - Not all past tournaments are stored, only ones of interest or requested.
- Team member skill rating displays
- Team average and top 6 average skill rating
    - These are pulled from overbuff.com so skill rating of players with private profiles can be very outdated
- Match results

*Note: Until GameBattles requires more information storing like map type and score all that can be collected is a win loss and team played.*

## In Development
- Ranking system for teams based off skill rating
  - Can be off because of outdated skill ratings from overbuff
- Ranking system for teams based of win loss
  - This will be pretty basic until gamebattles requires more match information to be reported in results
  - *Such as map and map score for more details*
- Bracket system for tournament
  - Can display teams and top 6 average skill rating to give a better understanding of matches and rounds
- Build your own bracket system
  - *This may or may not happen, depends on usage of app and storage needs for brackets*
